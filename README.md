# ethrex-l2-contracts-kit

A collection of useful smart contracts for deploying and running an L2 with [ethrex](https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex).  
This kit provides ready-to-use building blocks, reference implementations, and utilities to simplify L2 deployments.

## What’s inside
- **ERC20 reference contracts** – standard token contracts for bridging and testing  
- **Utility contracts** – helpers commonly needed in L2 setups  
- **Deployment examples** – simple scripts and configurations to get started quickly  

## Goals
- Provide **reliable references** for common L2 contract needs  
- Keep contracts **minimal, modular, and easy to extend**  
- Make it **easy for devs to bootstrap an L2** with ethrex  

## Usage
Clone the repo and use the contracts as starting points for your own L2 deployment:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lambdaclass/ethrex-l2-contracts-kit
```
